# CardioVascular-Risk-Prediction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a significant global health concern, contributing to high rates of morbidity and mortality. Timely identification of individuals at risk of developing CVD is crucial for implementing preventive measures and improving patient outcomes.

Machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach to develop predictive models for assessing cardiovascular risk. However, the challenge lies in creating models that are both accurate and generalizable across diverse populations.

This project aims to develop a robust ML algorithm for accurately predicting cardiovascular risk in patients based on clinical and demographic data. The primary objectives include:

Identifying the key risk factors associated with CVD and incorporating them into the predictive model.
Evaluating the effectiveness of various ML algorithms in detecting and classifying cardiovascular risk, and optimizing their performance.
Validating and testing the predictive model on independent datasets to assess its generalizability and real-world performance.
Through the application of advanced ML techniques and rigorous validation methods, this project aims to contribute to the development of accurate and reliable tools for cardiovascular risk assessment. 
Ultimately, the implementation of such predictive models can lead to significant advancements in preventive cardiology and public health.
